<h2>EDUCATION</h2>
<font size="4px" >
Seekho India’s Girl Education Programme (GEP) focuses on improving the conditions by which children, especially those in the marginalized communities can access quality education. 
Education is an important tool that enables children to participate in decisions that affect their lives and in improving their social status.
 GEP provides technical support while working through the formal school systems as well as through the integrated programs of Seekho India. 
 Following the enactment of the Right to Education Act by the Government, Seekho India has been actively engaged in several forums and consortiums along with other international agencies and the larger civil society to support the implementation of the Act in its true spirit. 
 GEP is committed towards enabling effective implementation of education provisions and policies for rights, entitlements and empowerment of girls from most marginalized sections of the society in safe and secure, inclusive and gender responsive environments.

<h3>KHUSHI: EARLY CHILDHOOD CARE AND EDUCATION (ECCE)</h3>

<font size="4px" >
<div>
Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) is the largest initiative of Government of India with a mandate of providing holistic services to young children for Pre-School Education, Health and immunization at the level of Anganwadi Centers (AWC). 
The period of Early Childhood represents the most significant and demanding stage in the developmental continuum of an individual. The first 6 years of a child’s life are globally acknowledged to be the most critical years with the pace of development being extremely rapid. Taking forward the experience of working in Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Bihar and Chhatisgarh, the intervention is in action in Bhilwara in Rajasthan.
Seekho India's thrust is that school readiness and the basic growth and development needs (i.e. cognitive, socio-emotional, physical and language) of the most vulnerable, marginalized children in the 0-6 years’ age group are met. The project focuses on system strengthening by building capacities of government functionaries and caregivers and creating feedback and support supervision systems. The role of the community is well recognized in addressing the needs of a child. Thus, community awareness and sensitization on the issues is quite imperative. CARE visions a systematic functional pre-school system that can be availed by children belonging to all backgrounds, especially Dalits and Adivasis. Thus, advocating for policy development models with government bodies and converging technical institutions to contribute to the vision is part of the program at large.

<h3> TEACHERS RESOURCE LABORATORY: BUILDING TEACHERS’ CAPACITIES</h3>
<img src="img60.jpg"></img>
<font size="4px">
The goal of the project is to improve conceptual clarity, sensitivity and instructional methods of teachers in the primary grades in the domains of language, science and mathematics in select clusters of Uttar Pradesh.
Researches indicate poor performances and competencies of children from government schools in the domains of language, math and science. CARE India’s Girl Education Programme (GEP) believes, that to tackle the issues of poor academic performances and learning outcomes, work needs to be done directly with the stakeholder that directly delivers education, viz. teachers. Lack of domain trained teachers for specific subjects, high pupil to teacher ratios in schools, insufficient in-service teacher’s training within current government framework and lack of continuous follow ups and hand-holding support has directly created a massive motivation deficit for teachers, thereby hampering the quality of delivery for students in government schools, most of whom belong to impoverished and marginalized sections of the society.
As part of this project, GEP has ‘layered’ the TRL on existing government platform of teachers’ training, i.e. ‘Cluster Resource Centres’ (CRCs). This translates to refurbishing of the CRC space and provisioning it with teachers’ learning material (TLM), which are developed using easily available materials. Monthly meetings of teachers held in these centers are also made vibrant, active and fruitful for teachers. Teachers are also given continuous and handholding support through joint regular visits of CRCCs (Cluster Resource Centres Coordinator) and GEP representatives to schools.
